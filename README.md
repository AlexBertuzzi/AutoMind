## Description 
AutoMind is an interactive application for car salesman to help keep ongoing client interaction organized. The salesman can create a secure account using name, email and password to then be taken into the main page where the clients are listed. The clients can be specifically viewed to update notes or update preferences or a call they are looking to buy. If clients are no longer interested there is also an option to delete the specific client.
